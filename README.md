# Assignment 4
## Exercise 1

A few variables have to be specified when running the script:
- the path for the input image, 
- the path where the resulting image should be saved,
- the width of the resulting image and
- the height of the resulting image.

An example for running opencv_click.py would be:
 > `python3 opencv_click.py -input 'sample_image.jpg' -output 'output_image.jpg' -width 700 -height 500`

## Exercise 2

### Bubble Game
Try to burst as many bubbles as possible. If a bubble hits the ground, your score decreases.
If you want to restart the game, press 'r'.
